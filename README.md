# Hangboard Log Sheet

I made these log sheets to keep track of the development of my finger training for rock climbing.
But they can be used to track pretty much whatever, as long as it can fit in a short note for each day.

Version 1 of these was done with a ruler and a pen on paper, every couple of weeks.
There exist way too many instances of Version 1 sheets because I always ended up procrastinating on making a printable design, and then had to draw another one when the current one was close to all filled out.

Each sheet tracks a period of six weeks.
That seemed to me a reasonable time frame to plan ahead for before reassessing and making bigger adaptations.
It’s also just about what fits on a single sheet of paper when I want lines tall enough that they can fit two lines of my handwriting in a pinch.

## How to Use

There’s no real magic to it, but here’s how I thought this up for me:
Print it out (A4 paper only for now, sorry Americans and other people subjected to their paper formats) and fill in some fields.

* DATE columns: For each line, month and day. (I use an abridged ISO-8601 date: mm-dd)
* Bottom right: (These are in the bottom right because when you put a stack of these in a folder, I find it easier to read the right half of the page when flipping through)
	* YEAR: The year this time frame takes place in.
	* WEEKS: The numbered calendar weeks this log sheet covers.
	* PLAN: What’s up for these six weeks. Could be the name of the fitness plan you’re on, preparation for an event, a sum-up in your own words, whatever)

Then, each day, write a short note on what you did in the line of today’s date in the EXERCISE column.
Use whatever shorthand works well for you and the training you do.
I find it useful to have a very simple sign for how well the session went:
Nothing when the session went as expected, - for when I underperformed, + for when I felt good about things, and --/++ for the very rare exceptional session.

If your tracked activity has some internal time frame, that’s what the TRK column is for.
Think time since injury for rehabilitation, which phase in your periodisation plan, how long until the 5k you’re signed up for, … or just use it to place a satisfying big check mark for each day you’ve been sticking to the plan.

Once the sheet is filled, write down a couple of points that came up in these six weeks in the NOTES column.
Flexibility gained, weights increased, average times improved, new exercises that worked or didn’t work, changes to the plan – think big picture things for the time frame logged.
